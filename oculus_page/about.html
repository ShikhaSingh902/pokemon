      <div class="describe">This club focuses on photography and videography aspects. It will be fun learning about editing n all.The idea of colours floating across a sheet of paper forming either familiar shapes or new creations is appealing to the eye. In reality, though it is much more than just the beads of colour. Photography can capture someone’s heart and soul. Even the simplest photo has a story that tails along with it. It is an escape from the real world; a creation that narrows on one particular subject and carefully details their every move and emotion. Photography provides us with sights of deep-sea sharks, microscopic bacteria, constellations-a million light years away, ravishing beauties and our passport pictures. A person sitting at the remotest area of any part of the world can enjoy the view of any wonder of the world. Its use is wide and varied and of tremendous importance to us. Non-existence of photography in the earlier times has left us with a very bleak image of our ancestors.

        In the contemporary world the practical applications of the photographic medium are legion; it is an important tool in education, medicine, commerce, criminology and the milifary. Its scientific applications include aerial mapping and surveying geology, reconnaissance, meteorology archaeology and anthropology. New techniques such as holography, a means of creating three-dimensional image in space, continue to expand the medium’s technological and creative horizons. In astronomy the Charge Coupled Device (CCD) can detect and register even a single photon of light. </div>
